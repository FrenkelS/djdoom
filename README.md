# DJGPP Doom
Download the executables [here](https://github.com/FrenkelS/djdoom/releases).

Which compiler produces the fastest Doom code?
[DJGPP](https://github.com/andrewwutw/build-djgpp) or [Watcom](https://github.com/open-watcom/open-watcom-v2)?

The code is based on [gamesrc-ver-recreation](https://bitbucket.org/gamesrc-ver-recreation/doom/src/master/)
and it took inspiration from [FastDoom](https://github.com/viti95/FastDoom) and [doomgeneric](https://github.com/ozkl/doomgeneric).

All the assembly code is replaced by C code.
There's no sound, no joystick and no Logitech Cyberman support.

Use `compdj.bat` to compile with DJGPP and `compwc.bat` to compile with Watcom.
